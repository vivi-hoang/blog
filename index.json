[{"content":"Ashikaga Flower Park #\rSo we‚Äôd finally arrived. It was the last day of our trip. Our flight out of Haneda Airport wasn‚Äôt until 11 p.m., though, so we still had a full day of sightseeing in front of us.\nI‚Äôd loved all the things we‚Äôd seen and done on this trip but this was definitely one of those vacations for which you need a subsequent vacation. I knew I‚Äôd gone hard but I come to Japan so infrequently that I could travel no other way!\nVannie and I checked out of the hotel in time to catch the 9:12 a.m. train out of Maihama Station to Tokyo. We stowed our luggage, once again in the Yaechika locker alcove, and hopped on a shinkansen to Ashikaga Flower Park.\nI‚Äôd seen photos of the wisteria in bloom at this park years ago and had clocked it as something I‚Äôd love to see with my own eyes if the timing worked out ‚Äî which was tricky, because I‚Äôd originally thought we‚Äôd make it for sakura season but miss fuji season, which happened slightly later. The opposite proved true: Though we‚Äôd largely missed the cherry blossoms, the wisteria were in full bloom.\nThe closer we got to Ashikaga Flower Park Station ‚Äî I should have intuited the demand if the park had its own train station ‚Äî the more terrible a feeling I got as more and more people got on the train obviously bound for the same place as us.\nBy the time we arrived at our stop, there was a crush of people both inside the train waiting to get off and outside the train waiting to get on.\nVannie and squeezed out. There were so many people that the station staff weren‚Äôt even requiring people to use the ticket gates; they were just manually collecting paper fares. Because we had our JR Passes, which (say it with me now!) weren‚Äôt meant to be turned in, we just flashed them to the staff to get by.\nThe garden was stunning, the tree branches dripping with purple and white wisteria, and all sorts of other flowers in full bloom. But the press of people, coupled with the warm, sunny day, was not pleasant, leading me to do a quick circuit of the park before we immediately left, not wanting to linger in such crowded circumstances and the heat.\nA purple wisteria tree\rWhite wisteria\rWhile I‚Äôm glad and grateful to have gotten to see the wisteria, which was spellbinding, given how massively popular this park is, coupled with its smaller size (it was certainly considerably smaller than Hitachi Seaside Park), I‚Äôm not sure I would recommend it.\nAshikaga Flower Park\rIkebukuro #\rOur sightseeing done for the day, we improvised our remaining hours in Tokyo. Vannie wanted to try a dessert buffet in Ikebukuro, so we headed in that direction by train.\nAlthough I‚Äôd always gotten reserved seats for our morning shinkansen rides, because we didn‚Äôt want to be bound to a specific time for returning, we usually just played the odds with unreserved seats when we rode the shinkansen back. Unfortunately, today this meant boarding a shinkansen bound for our layover station, Omiya, with no unreserved seats open.\nSo we squeezed in the vestibule between cars alongside several other passengers in the same position as us. Fortunately that leg of our trip was only about 20 minutes, though if felt like an eternity as I tried to not make eye contact with my neighbor passengers as we stood cheek-by-jowl.\nIt was on the last leg of our journey to Ikebukuro that Van realized she‚Äôd lost her locker receipt at some point during the day. The receipt had the QR code she needed to scan in order to reopen her locker. There was nothing to be done for the moment, so we just continued on to Ikebukuro.\nI looked up what else was in the Ikebukuro area and saw Itoya, the 12-story stationery shop we‚Äôd visited in Ginza on our first day, had another branch in Ikebukuro (though one that was much smaller than the Ginza shop). At this point we were trying to use up our remaining Japanese cash. It felt a little profligate to find reasons to spend our money but I persevered, I buying some postcards and a shitajiki writing board at the Ikebukuro Itoya.\nFrom there, we went in search of the dessert buffet, Sweets Paradise, or ‚ÄúSuipara.‚Äù The entrance proved surprisingly elusive. We ended up entering through the exit, and I‚Äôm still not sure, given that the stairs and the elevator opened to the same landing, where the entrance was situated.\nThe staff looked slightly exasperated by our bumbling but Japan isn‚Äôt known for its customer service for nothing; the staff directed us to the ticket machine for us to choose to the type of meal we wanted. We chose the option that offered the dessert buffet and the hot food minus ice cream, which cost more, and were told we had 70 minutes to eat.\nAll-you-can-eat sweets at Sweets Paradise\rDuring that time, I wrote postcards to my friends ‚Äî I stopped at the post office right afterward to mail them ‚Äî and ate steadily but sparingly so as not to irritate my stomach before our long outbound flight. Van had read it was a popular spot among students as a cheap meal where you could load up on food. It offered a variety of sweets but also food for a proper meal like rice, vegetables, soup and pasta. We definitely saw students there in their school uniforms, as well as mother-daughter pairings.\nBack to the airport #\rThe information desk at Yaechika shopping center was still open by the time we got back to Tokyo Station in the early evening. They directed us to an English-speaking employee, who called mall security and explained our situation with Vannie‚Äôs locker.\nWe thought there‚Äôd be a charge for this service ‚Äî our Google Translate of the signs on the lockers had suggested as much ‚Äî but there wasn‚Äôt! The staff did ask to review Van‚Äôs passport as well as have her describe her luggage before they handed it over but they made the process so efficient and straightforward, for which we were relieved and appreciative.\nVan‚Äôs luggage retrieved, we took the reverse journey back to the airport, riding the train back to Hamamatsucho Station and then the monorail to Haneda Airport.\nThere, I dropped into the mailbox right by the departures area our WiFi hotspot and its accessories into the postage-paid envelope that the company had included. So convenient!\nVannie wanted to take a shower but the Haneda shower room in Terminal 3 kept the weirdly inconvenient hours of 5 a.m. to noon daily and by then it was night time. So she bought entrance to the airport lounge so we could use its showers. It was my first time inside a lounge (and its showers), so a new and exciting experience for me.\nWhile we waited for our flight, Vannie used the last of our yen to buy souvenirs for our coworkers. And then we were saying goodbye to Japan.\n","date":"20 April 2023","permalink":"/posts/2023-04-20-day-11/","section":"Posts","summary":"Ashikaga Flower Park #\rSo we‚Äôd finally arrived.","title":"Day 11: Ashikaga Flower Park and Ikebukuro"},{"content":"We came for the cherry blossoms but we missed sakura season. üòÖ They bloomed early this year.\nI went to Japan for 10 days with my sister Van in April 2023.

It‚Äôd be the only day the entire trip that we didn‚Äôt ride public transit. (We did end up riding a train, but it was inside the park.)\nThe lines at the gate moved quickly and once we through, we headed immediately to Guest Services to inquire about getting Premiere Access passes for rides.\nIt turned out you could only get one pass for one ride at a time. Then, if you wanted another Premiere Access pass, you could come back to Guest Services and get another one. What madness was this? We weren‚Äôt thrilled by this limit at first but, again, that Japanese foresight proved wisest: We bought a Premiere Access pass for the most popular ride in the park, Soaring, and then afterward found the wait times for the all other rides in the park to be reasonable enough that we didn‚Äôt need any more Premiere Access passes.\nOur timed slot for Soaring was scheduled for mid-morning, so Vannie and I first went to Toy Story Mania, a fun 3D shooting gallery game that already had a substantial line. The line did not, unsurprisingly, improve as the day progressed, so we were grateful we were able to get in when we did.\nIn line for Toy Story Mania ü´†\rBy then it was time for our Soaring: Fantastic Flight slot. How satisfying it was to be able to bypass the line! The ride turned out exactly as my research had suggested: supremely gentle and a great experience. You got strapped into a contraption that slowly lifted you into the air as you gazed at the domed screen that surrounded you, which made you feel as though you were gliding over notable current and historic monuments.\nLunch was at Zambini Brothers‚Äô Ristorante, an Italian place with a pretty good set meal of seafood pasta with a slice of chocolate cake and mango sauce as well as a drink. We threw a churro in, too.\nSeafood pasta, cake and churros at the Zambini Brothers\rAfterward, we waited in line for Journey to the Center of the Earth, a rough-going ride with an inevitable drop ‚Äî but it was manageable! I did it!\nI wasn‚Äôt as thrilled with the seemingly innocuous 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea ride, which simulates going underwater. My claustrophobia already didn‚Äôt like the cramped car we huddled inside with a few other riders. This was made worse when the ride malfunctioned and we had to wait in these sardine cans until Disney cast members came and let us out. We climbed out onto scaffolding ‚Äî our only peek behind the curtain ‚Äî and were directed to the nearest exit.\nWaiting for rescue from our abruptly aborted ride on 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\rBy now I‚Äôd worked up the courage to ride Tower of Terror, the screams of which you could hear from pretty much any vantage of the park. It was set in a formerly grand decrepit old hotel with a possessed elevator. The elevator took us up several times, twice to the top of the hotel into a wrecked room with caved-in walls that let the sun shine in and gave us a brief glimpse out onto the theme park and the bay behind it ‚Äî only to immediately drop us several stories straight down in the pitch dark.\nBetween my repeated moans of ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù and ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like it!‚Äù I had so much fun that we went ended up riding the Tower of Terror twice.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s something wrong with the elevator at the Tower of Terror üòÜ\rIn between, we rode the DisneySea Electric Railway, a short train ride that took you from one side of the park to the other (a distance that was easily walkable, but I appreciated the chance to sit down) and the Indiana Jones Adventure: Temple of the Crystal Skull roller coaster, as well as some kids‚Äô rides like Scuttle‚Äôs Scooters and Flouder‚Äôs Flying Fish Coaster.\nVannie wanted to watch the scheduled afternoon performance of the Disney characters dancing on a boat that floated out into the lake in the middle of the park, so we staked out some spots by the water beforehand. While we were there, a cast member that did a fantastic Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow impression emerged with his handler to charm the crowds. I am terrified of situation like this, so hastily retreated until the pair left.\nTonkatsu at Maihama Station #\rWhen we finally had our fill of DisneySea rides, Vannie and I made our way toward Maihama Station, where there‚Äôd be much more eating options than around our hotel.\nWe ended up picking a tonkatsu place with a short waiting list. I wrote my name in katakana on the paper waiting list, which Van took great interest in, since she‚Äôd never seen what Vivi looks like spelled that way („É¥„Ç£„É¥„Ç£).\nThis is how I write my name in katakana\rThe restaurant served us a delicious traditional Japanese meal with a variety of breaded and fried food: pork cutlet, meatball, egg plant and shrimp, along with miso soup, rice and a chewy mochi dessert. I was so pleased we got a chance to eat these dishes; I love them, but almost never eat them back in the U.S.\nOur traditional Japanese dinner at a tonkatsu restaurant\rOur bellies full, coming off the high of a day spent at our second theme park in Japan, we hopped on the hotel shuttle for the night.\n","date":"19 April 2023","permalink":"/posts/2023-04-19-day-10/","section":"Posts","summary":"DisneySea #\rOn the one-mile walk to DisneySea from our hotel, we saw absolutely no other tourists on our way there as we passed a park and baseball field, which begged the question: Did everyone else use a shuttle to get there?","title":"Day 10: DisneySea"},{"content":"Returning to Tokyo #\rToday‚Äôs goal was mainly returning to Tokyo so we could go to DisneySea the next day. That being said, it only takes three hours by shinkansen to get to Tokyo from Osaka, so I knew I wanted to get some sightseeing in.\nVan and I caught the 8:19 a.m. bullet train from Shin-Osaka Station. Since we‚Äôd be arriving in Tokyo area around 11 a.m., we wouldn‚Äôt have been able to check in yet for several hours. It was too much trouble to journey to the hotel just for the sake of dropping off our luggage, so I opted to leave our luggage at lockers at Tokyo Station.\nThis time instead of using lockers in the Gransta shopping arcade surrounding Tokyo Station ‚Äî which we found mostly occupied and stressed me out anyway, because the lockers usually lined the busy corridors so you were always surrounded by a stream of people ‚Äî we found a bank of lockers in the adjoining Yaechika shopping mall, tucked away in an offshoot corridor by a women‚Äôs restroom, out of the path of foot traffic, which was such a relief.\nThe lockers we used at Yaechika\rI like the station‚Äôs locker system: You pay with cash or with your SUICA card. If you pay with cash, you got a receipt with a QR code that you scan to reopen your locker later. If you pay with your SUICA card, you scan the card itself to reopen your locker.\nObviously paying with your phone would have been a nice option ‚Äî I had used my phone, for example, to pay for my camera lens ‚Äî so I‚Äôm really glad we‚Äôd made the effort to obtain a SUICA card for this trip.\nConveyor belt sushi #\rFrom Tokyo, we rode the train for about an hour before alighting at Kawagoe Station. The town of Kawagoe is known as ‚Äúlittle Edo.‚Äù Like Kurashiki, it has a district with buildings reminiscent of traditional Edo era-style architecture (1603-1867).\nBefore Van and I walked over to that district, however, we went in search of lunch. One thing that I‚Äôd hoped Van would get to experience while we were in Japan was conveyor belt sushi, known as kaitenzushi. However, in the weeks leading up to our arrival, there‚Äôd been a spate of ‚Äúconveyor belt sushi terrorism‚Äù pranks in which people were doing unhygienic things like licking the communal soy sauce bottles or messing with the food passing on the conveyor belt. As a result, a lot of conveyor belt sushi places had shut down their conveyor belts and turned to traditional ordering practices.\nVan and I had done a little reconnaissance via Google Maps on our sushi options leading up to our Kawagoe outing. The reviews were pretty hilarious. For example, reviewers at one kaitenzushi place had noted (obviously before the whole sushi terrorism debacle) that the conveyor belt moved so fast that it was a food-flinging hazard.\nVan and I had eventually settled on Genki Sushi, located in a shopping arcade near Kawagoe Station, and it had a translated Japanese-to-English review complaining that ‚Äúconveyor not rotating.‚Äù Nevertheless, we thought we‚Äôd give it a try and see what the experience was like.\nUpon entering the chain restaurant, we at first thought we needed to wait to be seated like a traditional restaurant. But after a moment, I noticed a tablet near the entrance where you entered in the number of people in your party and the tablet directed you to an unoccupied table.\nAt the table was another tablet that you could use to order your food, which was then delivered expeditiously by the two-level conveyor belt that snaked around the establishment. We helped ourselves to cups of green tea: All the supplies, including a hot water dispenser, were provided at the able.\nWe struggled a bit at first with the ordering ‚Äî it took us a while to discover there was an English-language menu ‚Äî but once we figured it out, it was a delight to use. The app limited orders to four dishes at a time, which we balked at, at first ‚Äî you‚Äôre not the boss of me! ‚Äî but in hindsight I‚Äôm sure that was done in an effort to limit food waste, which is really smart move. Not that we were wasteful! We ate everything we ordered!\nThat\u0026rsquo;s a double conveyor belt!\rWe ate until we were comfortably full and then marked on the tablet that we were done. At the front of the restaurant, another machine pulled up our final bill ‚Äî a paltry ¬•1,460 total or about $10 for the both of us. I paid with cash, floored (I‚Äôm still floored!) by how cheap sushi is in Japan.\nKawagoe #\rProperly fortified, Van and walked down the shopping arcade toward the historic district. Van came across a taiyaki shop and ordered herself another fish-shaped pastry with red bean paste as a post-lunch treat. I saw a stationery shop, which I immediately zoomed into, emerging with several lovely paper products.\nThe historic district did, in fact, have two-story clay-walled buildings with majestic, steeply pitched tiled roofs. But unlike Kurashiki, where you could walk leisurely along the canal in a car-free environment, in Kawagoe, you had to walk on the sidewalk because a rather busy street ran down the center of the district.\nA busy thoroughfare runs through the Kawagoe historic district.\rBut there was pudding.\rFrom the historic district, Vannie and I walked a few blocks over to Kawagoe Hikawa Shrine, where stands a nearly 50-foot-tall wooden torii gate, one of the largest in Japan. The Shinto shrine, thought to be about 1,500 years old, itself is surrounded by smaller shrines and holy trees.\nPerson at the bottom for scale\rVan and I retraced our steps back to the historic district, where I popped into a post office to mail off some postcards. International postage was so cheap compared to how much I‚Äôd paid when I was in Scotland also sending postcards to the U.S.\nBack in the shopping arcade, we zeroed in on a banh mi shop we spied earlier that day. We thought it‚Äôd be great to get some Vietnamese sandwiches to go and eat them at the hotel in Maihama, where we were bound that evening.\nWhen we entered the sandwich shop, Banh Mi Ba Ba, the owner was in the middle of a conversation with two people seated at a table. He greeted us and when we greeted him back, he could tell we weren‚Äôt from there and I heard him say to his visitors, ‚ÄúOh I thought they were Vietnamese,‚Äù so I said, ‚ÄúOh we‚Äôre American but our parents our Vietnamese.‚Äù Then the owner got really excited because his wife is Vietnamese. She actually came in with their 2-year-old daughter while we were chatting.\nWhile Van and I waited for our orders to be made, we hung out with the wife, daughter and the two friends who‚Äôd already been in the shop when we came in. They were so friendly. The owner insisted we take a picture together. Getting the photo to us proved tricky: We didn‚Äôt have iPhones, so he couldn‚Äôt AirDrop them to us, nor did we have Instagram for him to share them with us that way.\nIn the end, he emailed the photo to me, something I didn‚Äôt discover until I checked my Spam folder several days after we‚Äôd returned to the U.S.\nBanh mi brings everyone together\rMaihama #\rWith our sandwiches in hand, Van and I made the journey back to Tokyo, where we retrieved our luggage and made our way to Maihama Station, the station closest Tokyo Disneyland, which is actually composed of two theme parks, Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea. I‚Äôd booked a hotel within walking distance of DisneySea.\nRiding the train to get to Maihama at that time of day was a nightmare. It was the middle of rush hour, which seems to last several hours. My aversion to crowds meant more than once I‚Äôd asked Vannie if she was okay with waiting for the next one, knowing full well there was no guarantee it‚Äôd be any better. Vannie on the other hand, never minded shoving ourselves and our luggage into a crush of people. ‚ÄúJust squeeze!‚Äù she‚Äôd say. ‚ÄúSqueeze!‚Äù So squeeze I reluctantly did. We extruded ourselves out at Maihama Station, where we caught the hotel shuttle to our accommodations, the Spa \u0026amp; Hotel Eurasia Maihama.\nOf the three places we stayed during the course of our trip, our hotel room here was by far the largest, with two beds and a couch that could easily have served as a third bed, plus additional seats for louging. After the tight spaces we‚Äôd grown used to, the space felt downright luxurious, with room to stretch out and spread our things.\nWe ate our banh mi for dinner but still felt peckish. Our hotel was not close to the business district around the station ‚Äî it very much felt industrial and not particularly tourist-friendly (though not, it must be said, unsafe, because c‚Äômon, it‚Äôs still Japan) ‚Äî but there was a Daily Yamazaki conbini down the street. Grabbing our shopping bags, we made a quick nighttime walk to the conbini for ice cream (of course) and breakfast goods.\nBack at the hotel we attempted to figure out how we can wrangle a DisneySea equivalent of USJ‚Äôs Express Pass for the rides. This proved confusing and ultimately unsuccessful, so we decided to make a beeline for Guest Services first thing in the morning when we made it through the ticket gate at DisneySea.\n","date":"18 April 2023","permalink":"/posts/2023-04-18-day-09/","section":"Posts","summary":"Returning to Tokyo #\rToday‚Äôs goal was mainly returning to Tokyo so we could go to DisneySea the next day.","title":"Day 9: Kawagoe"},{"content":"Isn‚Äôt amazing when transportation planners expect a tourist attraction will get so much traffic that it warrants its own train stop? That made getting to Universal Studios Japan in Osaka a breeze. We took the train the 25 minutes to Universal City Station, which was a quick walk to the theme park‚Äôs entrance.\nBased on travel blogs, we‚Äôd arrived in advance of the park‚Äôs opening at 9 a.m. to give us time to go through through the lines at security, where they checked the contents of our backpacks, and the ticket gates, where we showed the QR codes from the tickets we‚Äôd bought online at Klook. The lines moved quickly and overall it was a smooth process, for which I was grateful.\nI was already a little nervous because I‚Äôm actually not a big fan of theme parks or intense rides ‚Äî USJ had been on the itinerary because Van had wanted to hit an amusement park ‚Äî so I‚Äôd told Vannie that she was welcome to ride anything she wanted, I just might have to sit out the scarier ones. But in the end, we ended up riding all rides together, including some I may have sat out previously, and I had a fantastic time on them. We didn‚Äôt do any of the high-power roller coasters but there were still some steep drops and deliberately rough turns in some of the rides we did take.\nOur Express Passes, which we‚Äôd also bought on Klook, included a timed entry later in the day to Super Nintendo World to ride Yoshi‚Äôs Adventure, so we prioritized the Harry Potter portion as the first place we wanted to hit before the lines got long.\nThe Wizarding World of Harry Potter #\rThe entire village of Hogsmeade and Hogwarts Castle was identical to what we‚Äôd experienced at Universal Studios Orlando on a cousin trip six years before, which didn‚Äôt bother me at all. The attention to detail is amazing. I only wish that all the storefronts opened to actual stores rather than serving only as a facade half the time, but this, too, is consistent with the Hogmeade village in Orlando.\nOllivander\u0026rsquo;s wand shop\rThe wait for Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey wasn‚Äôt bad, maybe 15 minutes, but again, this was not long after the park had opened. By the time we headed over to the Flight of the Hippogriff, the wait for that roller coaster was about 45 minutes.\nFlight of the HIppogriff roller coaster\rUsing the USJ app, we next navigated over to Jujutsu Kaisen: The Real 4D, a regularly scheduled animated show in which you sit in theater seats that vibrated along with the action occurring onscreen.\nLunch #\rVan and I grabbed an early lunch at Louie‚Äôs New York Pizza Parlor, which I have to say had an impressively efficient factory-like quality to its ordering process in order to manage the throngs of people, many of them non-Japanese-speaking, who came through each day. They had a limited menu in Japanese and English with an emphasis on set meals to keep things simple. We each ended up getting the pizza set, which came with a big slice of pizza and a side of fries, plus an order of fried boneless chicken.\nMinion Park #\rOnce we were finished eating, there was still time before our timed entry to Super Nintendo World, so we hit Minion Park for the kid-friendly Freeze Ray Sliders and park attraction Despicable Me: Minion Mayhem ride.\nA sign warned, ‚ÄúThis attraction is a ride that includes sudden acceleration, stops, rises, drops, and dramatic feelings caused by tilts and jolts.‚Äù Having just eaten, this did give me some trepidation. In addition, I knew this ride, which took place in a car that went nowhere, used the hyper-realistic projection system on a dome screen also present in Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey. I had to keep my eyes closed at those parts (which meant I kept my eyes closed most of the Minion ride) because the swirling animations made me nauseous.\nLuckily the Harry Potter ride had taken ook place in a car that was on a track, so the real-life portions featuring animatronics, such as with the dragon, I was able to enjoy.\nSuper Nintendo World #\rSuper Nintendo World honestly turned out to be an overcrowded fever dream that I could have done without. It‚Äôs in an enclosed space with high walls, that when coupled with masses of people teeming inside those walls, made the area seem quite suffocating.\nGet me out of here\rNevertheless, we were determined to use our timed slot for Yoshi‚Äôs Adventure, which turned out to be a slow-moving kid‚Äôs ride.\nYoshi\u0026rsquo;s Adventure\rI didn‚Äôt mind it, and it did offer great vantage point to view Super Nintendo World without being jostled by other visitors. When we finished, there was still time left on our timed entry, so we tried to make our way back through the Express Pass line but, pro tip, Universal Studios only allows one ride per Express Pass timed entry, so we were politely asked to get in the normal line.\nWe‚Äôd liked Yoshi‚Äôs Adventure but not enough to wait in line for it. There were other rides in Super Nintendo World ‚Äî Mario Kart: Koopa‚Äôs Challenge and Power-Up Band Key Challenges ‚Äî but the wait was just too long as well for them so we just moved on entirely.\nAmity Village #\rJaws, the boat ride, involved the ‚Äútour guide‚Äù casually whipping out a giant gun and shooting at the water whenever the shark surfaced. Van and I were not expecting that threat mitigation method at all (especially in a country where guns are banned), and it caused no amount of entertainment for us every time the tour guide paused to haphazardly take aim at the water, which was followed by a theatrical explosion.\nBut the surrounding set ‚Äî the building, signs and nautical accessories ‚Äî evoked New England so well. We really felt like we were briefly back in the States as we puttered around the ‚Äúbay‚Äù avoiding the shark.\nUniversal Wonderland #\rThe kids‚Äô rides here were a fun interlude between the park‚Äôs bigger rides. The Flying Snoopy was a fun diversion. We took a spin in Hello Kitty‚Äôs Cupcake Dream, a ride analogous to Disney‚Äôs tea cup ride. On Big Bird‚Äôs Big Top Circus carousel, Vannie did not take kindly to bald baby who rode beside her and kept staring at her.\nJurassic Park #\rOur Express Pass allowed us to breeze right through to practically the front of the line at Jurassic Park - The Ride. The attraction started out reasonably enough ‚Äî on a ‚Äúboat‚Äù on a track navigating through the island‚Äôs lab facilities, now overrun with dinosaurs.\nWe loved this ride so much we did it twice!\rNevertheless, I knew something bad was coming up. Of all the rides we took today, this one gave me the most trepidation. I mostly spent the ride shaking my head muttering, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like it,‚Äù and simply, ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù as I braced myself for the worst. And inevitably, it presented itself at the conclusion as our boat ticked slowly upward on the track and we were met with a roaring T-Rex, only for our boat to plunge steeply down and careen back into the water.\nThe ensuing splash was such a fun, thrilling way to end the ride. We loved it so much, and the normal line was reasonable enough (since the Express Pass was only good for one pass-through), that after tooling around the kiddie rides at Universal Wonderland, Van and I decided to call it a day with one last go on Jurassic Park - The Ride.\nThis time, we ended up at the front of the boat. The cast member ushering us into our seats asked if we were okay with getting wet. We‚Äôd already gotten wet the first time we‚Äôd taken the ride and thought nothing of it happening again.\nWhat we hadn‚Äôt accounted for, however, was how much more water you get dumped on you when you‚Äôre sitting in the front. At the end of the ride we emerged, soaked to the skin. Our jackets had mostly kept our torsos dry but our pants, shoes and socks were lost causes. Nevertheless, we couldn‚Äôt keep the grins off our faces.\nWe squished our way back to the train to take us back to the AirBnB.\n","date":"17 April 2023","permalink":"/posts/2023-04-17-day-08/","section":"Posts","summary":"Isn‚Äôt amazing when transportation planners expect a tourist attraction will get so much traffic that it warrants its own train stop?","title":"Day 8: Universal Studios Japan"},{"content":"Kibi Plain #\rThis day was reserved for renting bikes and riding the trail between Bizen Ichinomiya and Soja Stations, located in the rural flatlands of Kibi Plain just outside Okayama.\nI knew I‚Äôd wanted to fit in a nice bike ride into the trip if one was possible, one that didn‚Äôt involve riding in the city and having to contend with lots of other people. So it was boon when I came across the 10-mile Kibiji cycling route.\nWhen Van and I got off at Bizen-Ichinomiya Station, I clutched my Japan Rail Pass to myself, yesterday‚Äôs travails still fresh in my mind. immediately noticed that this station, too, was unmanned as Hokaiin Station had been the day before. Except with one big difference: A sign at the gate that specifically said in Japanese and English to not put your J Rail Passes in the box. Had it been there all this time? I‚Äôm sure other travelers have done the same and Japan Rail had put these signs out long before, and Hokaiin Station was just missing one, was all. Or had Japan Rail put it up overnight because of my mishap? I admit a small part of me wondered (with no amount of horror) if it was because of me.\nThis sign was already here, right? \u0026hellip; right?? üò¨\rWhatever the case, just as described, there was a bicycle shop right next to the station. You saw it immediately when you excited. It was manned by an elderly couple who got us sorted with our bicycle rentals. They even had a laminated book of photographs with to help walk us through the route. I took pictures of the instructions just in case we needed to refer to them but knew there was little chance I‚Äôd want to stop constantly to refer to them.\nVan and I started off by visiting a shrine close by with giant carp streamers floating in the wind and a sculpture of Kibitsuhiko no Mikoto, the famed prince who vanquished Ura the demon and serves as inspiration for Peach Boy, or Momotaro.\nGiant carp streamers\rAs we continued, it turns out the path had signs painted on the pavement to mark the way. I nevertheless still missed a turn but a local resident burning organic waste in a field kindly pointed us to where we needed to be.\nWe passed by so many rice fields, shrines and historic sites along the way. I chose not to stop because I‚Äôve already seen plenty and we also had another destination after the ride.\nOn our biycles\rOnce we got to Soja, we dropped off our bikes at the shop by the station. We missed our train, so walked around for looking for food but it turned out to be a business desert largely devoid of shops, restaurants, conbini or grocery stores. So we just returned to the station to wait for the next train, due an hour later.\nKurashiki #\rA quick 10-minute train ride later, we were in Kurashiki, where we walked to the Bikan Historical Quarter, known for its weeping willow-lined canals and the beautiful Edo-era (1603-1867) architecture of its buildings, which formerly served as storehouses for rice.\nKurashiki\u0026rsquo;s historic district\rVan and I ate udon at a tradition Japanese restaurant in the historic district and then perused the shops along the canal.\nUdon, tempura and green tea\rI ended up buying some chopstick rests at one of the stores, which I plan to use as a pen rest, and we also treated ourselves to soft-serve ice cream made with local seasonal ingredients: muscat grape for me and peach for Vannie.\nThe best way to end a meal\r","date":"16 April 2023","permalink":"/posts/2023-04-16-day-07/","section":"Posts","summary":"Kibi Plain #\rThis day was reserved for renting bikes and riding the trail between Bizen Ichinomiya and Soja Stations, located in the rural flatlands of Kibi Plain just outside Okayama.","title":"Day 7: The Kibi Plain, and Kurashiki"},{"content":"Exploring the neighborhood #\rAnother specific request Van had for this trip was riding the Hello Kitty shinkansen, which runs between Osaka and Fukuoka. Honestly, this is what brought us down to Osaka in the first place or else I would have had us go elsewhere since I‚Äôve already been to Osaka. That‚Äôs okay, because I was pretty happy with the things we ended up doing in the area.\nFor this first day in Osaka, the plan was to take the train west to Okayama, where we‚Äôd explore some parks in the area. It turns out the Hello Kitty shinkansen only runs once a day in either direction, so that made our departure time pretty straightforward. It didn‚Äôt leave until just after 11:30 a.m., so Van and I used the morning to explore the neighborhood around our AirBnB.\nOur first stop was a Mister Donut shop (or ‚ÄúMisdo,‚Äù as the chain is known) down the main street from us. Inside there was a self-serve shelf full of beautiful donuts for us to select and pull onto our trays.\nSelf-service donuts at Mister Donut\rAfter having paid for our donuts, which we planned to take back to the AirBnB, we found a grocery store a few streets over and stocked up on some more food.\nAlthough I remember really struggling in the grocery when I first moved to Japan as an illiterate JET ‚Äî was this salt or sugar that I was looking at?? ‚Äî as my reading skills improved (although they remain deplorable) I really grew to love the quality and variety of Japanese grocery store offerings. Like Japanese convenient stores, the pre-prepared foods at Japanese groceries are both tasty and certainly healthier than their American counterparts. And so many different ramen varieties to choose from!\nHello Kitty shinkansen #\rOur food supply secured, Van and I hopped on the day‚Äôs Hello Kitty shinkansen, riding it for just over an hour. The exterior of the bullet train was pink and white, with Hello Kitty highlighting a different region on the route on the outside of each car.\nThe Hello Kitty shinkansen\rWe had reserved seats to ensure spots on the train but the reserved-seat cars were just normals cars that looked like any other train‚Äôs. The special cars were Numbers 1 and 2, so once the train started pulled away from the platform at Shin-Osaka, Van and I made our way to the front to check them out.\nCar 2 had non-reserved seats upholstered in pink and purple, with a spot for selfies at the front sporting a life-size Kitty-chan (as Hello Kitty is known in Japan). Car 1 was entirely decked out in Hello Kitty colors and decorations and had a mini Hello Kitty shop with merch for purchase.\nAll my fears come true #\rAt Okayama, we transferred trains and went one stop over to a small unmanned station, Hokaiin Station, where all my JR Pass fears manifested.\nWhen we got off the train, I headed as usual to the ticket gate. Without thinking, I put my JR Pass into the first slot in the gate that I saw, only to realize the second I dropped it into the slot that I shouldn‚Äôt have done that.\nUnlike the automated ticket gates at all the other stations we‚Äôd been to, Hokain Station was so small that their gate wasn‚Äôt automated. In fact, the slot was just an opening to a locked box. You dropped your ticket into it if you had a single, terminal fare ticket and so obviously no longer needed it.\nBut I immediately knew if you had a JRail Pass, you just held onto it.\nWhy did I put my JR Pass in there üò≠\rIn my shock, I froze up, which prevented Vannie from coming behind me and making the same mistake. I was also blocking all the other train passengers who wanted to get through. I moved aside in a daze. A gentleman passing us heard my distressed conversation with Vannie. He slowly raised a hand to point to the intercom system over by the counter window. The shades were drawn at the window since no employee was working at the station, so the intercom was our only way of reaching an employee.\nI don‚Äôt do great at in-person interactions in Japanese, so an audio-only conversation was going to be awful. With dread, I pushed the button and was answered by a brusque Japanese male voice. I explained in halting, I‚Äôm sure barely coherent Japanese, that I‚Äôd put my JR Pass into the box and asked what I should do.\nThe man replied but I didn‚Äôt understand what he wanted me to do. I asked him to repeat himself, hoping he‚Äôd elaborate enough for me to pick up on his meaning but he just did as I asked, which was repeat the same exact words several more times.\nI pulled up the Google Translate app and though it was able to listen to what he was saying and produce an English translation, I remained mystified and still had to take a guess (very reminiscent of my entire two years on JET). While I was still processing what he was trying to convey, I heard him do the reverse on his end, playing a translation of his words in English over the connection.\nIn the end, I felt he was telling me to just ride the train as normal, as though I didn‚Äôt have a JR Pass, and thus pay for my tickets individually ‚Äî the very scenario I‚Äôd wanted to avoid in the first place because we had so much more train travel ahead of us.\nHandayama Botanical Garden #\rTroubled, but knowing there was nothing I could do about it at the moment, I decided the best thing to do was carry on with our plans. Van and I proceeded on to the Handayama Botanical Garden, situated in the hills overlooking the city of Okayama.\nIt was raining, which suited my mood, and likely because of the rain, the park was deserted ‚Äî unlike every single other park we‚Äôd visited and would go on to the visit during the course of our trip. After paying the paltry ¬•310 entry fee, we found we essentially had the park to ourselves, which was a boon.\nThe park, though not as grand as the other gardens we‚Äôd seen and would see, still had a nice selection of flora, including peony and tulip gardens as well as 1,000 cherry trees total of 45 different varieties. To my pleasure, many of them were in bloom. I firmly believe the two best ways to view cherry blossoms is 1) on a cherry tree-lined avenue as sakura petals gently rain down and 2) in the rain. Bonus points if both conditions are true!\nCherry blossoms at Handayama\rResolution #\rAfter Handayama, I‚Äôd originally planned for us to visit Korakuen Garden beside Okayama Castle but I was too stressed out about my JR Pass. Instead, Van and I returned to Okayama Station (I paid for the single fare return ticket ‚Äî the cost of which, granted, was minimal), the hub station in the region, where I figured I‚Äôd have better odds for an improved outcome because it had a ticket center where I could speak directly to an employee.\nThe line at the counter was not short, so I stood in line waiting for a while. When I finally made it to the counter to speak to the employee, my opening salvo in rudimentary Japanese went something line: ‚ÄúI had a JR Pass. This morning I went to Hokaiin Station. At Hokaiin Station, I put my JR Pass in the ticket machine. Now I don‚Äôt have my JR Pass.‚Äù As a visual aide, I showed a picture of the ticket box that now held my pass.\nThe employee got it right away. I had my passport with me ‚Äî the last few digits of your passport are printed on your JRail Pass ‚Äî and secretly hoped they could just nullify my pass in the system and issue me a new one. But I also knew Japanese bureaucracy doesn‚Äôt work that way. The rules are the rules.\nHowever, they threw me a lifeline. The employee consulted with his manager and returned, giving me my choices: I could wait for an employee to go to Hokaiin Station and retrieve my pass or I could just take an L and buy individual tickets going forward. I asked how long the wait would be. More consultation. The employee returned to say: ‚ÄúAbout 30 minutes.‚Äù\nThrilled that this was even an option, I said I‚Äôd wait. He gestured to a bench nearby. Within 20 minutes, the employee came to the counter with my JR Pass. I thanked him profusely, in slight belief they‚Äôd gone to so much trouble but so, so grateful that they had.\nSo relieved I got my JR Pass back\rRamen dinner #\rWhile I‚Äôd been at the ticket center, Vannie had been browsing the shops at the station and found something that had caught her eye. After I recovered my J Rail Pass, we returned to the shop, Lupica, which specialized in loose leaf tea.\nOkayama Prefecture is known for its muscat grape, and she ended up getting some muscat-flavored tea. It smelled delicious and was such a nice souvenir of the place and trip.\nVan and I hopped on the shinkansen back to Osaka, where we went in search of dinner. We‚Äôd not had proper ramen yet, so we went to a ramen restaurant a few blocks from our AirBnB. Based on the copious amounts of garlic cloves hanging around the restaurant, this place may have specialized in garlic-infused ramen, but I‚Äôm not sure. I got ramen with copious amounts of seaweed ‚Äî I felt I need some veg in my system ‚Äî and it was great. Hard to go wrong with ramen.\nRamen makes everything better\rOn our walk back to the AirBnB, we popped into a conbini for ice cream to bring back with us. When we came out of the conbini it was pouring. We booked it back to the AirBnB to dry out and enjoy our frozen treats.\n","date":"15 April 2023","permalink":"/posts/2023-04-15-day-06/","section":"Posts","summary":"Exploring the neighborhood #\rAnother specific request Van had for this trip was riding the Hello Kitty shinkansen, which runs between Osaka and Fukuoka.","title":"Day 6: Okayama"},{"content":"Nippori Fabric Town #\rBecause the only thing I‚Äôd planned for today was an outdoor art exhibition in Osaka that opened at 7 p.m., Van and I had the the majority of the day free. The only thing we had to make sure to do was catch the shinkansen down to Osaka in time for the evening art exhibit.\nI love how a metropolis the size of Tokyo has specialized neighborhoods, in the way that there were numerous camera shops in the Shibuya area with new and secondhand goods.\nThis was an opportunity. If Japanese stationery was lovely, I reasoned, what would their fabric be like? When I looked online for ideas, sure enough, there was a neighborhood in Tokyo known for its fabric shops: Nippori Fabric Town.\nGetting ready to check out of our Tokyo hotel\rSo Van and I checked out of the hotel that morning and left our luggage in lockers at Tokyo Station. We hopped on a train to Nippori Station and walked the short distance to Nippori Fabric Town, where it was just before 10 a.m. and shops would soon open.\nNippori Fabric Town was maybe two or three blocks long but it was incredible to suddenly be on a street where almost every single shop was devoted to fabric and sewing. I had to fight down the wild-eyed urge to see all the fabric, which I knew was an impossibility, given that we were only there for the morning and that some of these shops were several stories tall. So we went from shop to shop, circling back when some opened later in the morning, and I gleefully just absorbed the beautiful designs.\nTrying to decide what fabric to get\rI started out buying a sewing pattern for a Japanese-style apron. I actually already made one for myself last year, but I‚Äôm not crazy about the cut nor the fabric that I used (too lightweight), and have been wanting to make a Version 2.0. The pattern instructions were in Japanese, so I asked the women at the register to point me toward the length of fabric I‚Äôd need to get for my size. They helpfully pointed to the relevant numbers, dependent on the width of the fabric I‚Äôd be using.\nDown the street, after much frantic deliberation, I chose some omamori-themed print fabric. Omamori are lucky talismans sold at religious sites in Japan. I really liked how the print choice immediately identified it as a Japanese fabric because you wouldn‚Äôt see this pattern in the United States.\nI handed the apron pattern to the shop employee when he went to cut my fabric because I didn‚Äôt know the fabric width to be able to ask for a specific length. We figured it out together and at the end of the transaction the employee very sweetly said thank you in English to us.\nThose two purchases still weren‚Äôt enough, even though I knew didn‚Äôt have all that much spare space in my luggage. But I just couldn‚Äôt help myself. Van and I discovered that there was a shop called Tomato that apparently was so expansive that it covered six separate stores along the street, each carrying different kinds of fabric.\nWe went to the main store, which was five stories crammed full of fabric and shoppers, where I ended up buying some carp-themed print fabric.\nteamLab in Osaka #\rSatisfied with my souvenirs, I returned with Van to Tokyo Station. We retrieved our luggage and hopped onto the shinkansen for the three-hour ride to Osaka. Our AirBnB was at Higashimikuni, one stop over on the Osaka Metro from Shin-Osaka Station.\nWe rested for a bit at the AirBnB until it was time to leave for Nagai Botanical Garden. I‚Äôd last visited Nagai park with my other sister An 20 years ago when she‚Äôd come to visit me in Japan. This time, however, I was going at night for the teamLab art installation, which has set up through a portion of the park with special lights and sound features.\nEven with pre-purchased tickets, Van and I still had to wait a while before we were granted admittance. The staff let in limited groups of people at a time. Once you were inside the gate, they had you watch a short video explaining the art installation.\nFrom there, we meandered the teamLab exhibit, which included two separate egg installations with different kinds of glowing, life-size eggs that changed color. Very Instagram-worthy, if I had an Instagram.\nA forest of glowing egg-shaped scupltures\rA light sculpture at teamLab\rThere were giant brutalist structure in the water painted with coalescing pools of light, another nemophilia field (not as impressive in the dim night light) and and floating lantern-like sculptures.\nOn our walk back to the Osaka Metro station, Van and I passed by a big Japanese grocery store across the street from the park. We picked up dinner and snacks to bring back with us to the AirBnB.\nOur groceries: milk, juice, fruit, onigiri, packaged meals, pastries and sweets\r","date":"14 April 2023","permalink":"/posts/2023-04-14-day-05/","section":"Posts","summary":"Nippori Fabric Town #\rBecause the only thing I‚Äôd planned for today was an outdoor art exhibition in Osaka that opened at 7 p.","title":"Day 4: Nippori (Tokyo) and Nagai Park (Osaka)"},{"content":"Hitachi Seaside Park #\rAlthough we‚Äôd largely missed cherry blossom season in Tokyo, there were still plenty of other flowers in season. This was most apparent when we went to Hitachi Seaside Park for the day in Hitachinaka, an hour and a half northeast of Tokyo by train.\nUpon arriving at Katsuta Station at 9:30 a.m., I immediately popped into the travel center at the station to ask which bus we‚Äôd need to take to get to the park. I spoke in Japanese to the woman at the counter so it wasn‚Äôt until she gestured to the tourist maps available to us that she discovered we were American when I chose the English-language map.\nShe asked where in the U.S. we were from and when we told her Portland, Oregon, she got so excited. Apparently she lived in Portland in the 1990s and she still thought very fondly of it. The woman had already been kind and professional but when she heard we‚Äôd come from Portland, her demeanor became even warmer, as we if we were old friends. I felt kind of bad excusing ourselves to go catch the bus!\nDownstairs at the bus circle, it was apparent the city was well-equipped for the hordes of Hitachi park visitors: There was a bus route running directly to the park from the station, and a table set up right by the bus platform where you could buy a combo bus pass and park admission.\nOur bus was standing room only and we arrived at the park just after it had opened at 10 a.m. Already crowds of people were streaming through the ticket gates into the park.\nAs you know, I hate crowds but honestly the flower gardens at the park were so well-manicured and spread out that they were worth the visit. The park was big enough that even with the masses of people I didn‚Äôt feel smothered.\nUpon entering the park, Van and I immediately made our way to the park highlight that everyone else was going to at this time of year: the nemophilia fields, these hills covered in charming sky blue flowers known as baby blue eyes.\nThe nemophilia fields at Hitachi Seaside Park\rWisely, the park doesn‚Äôt let you actually walk in the fields. They‚Äôre roped off and you walk alongside them on walking paths, which were packed with people and no small number of dogs. There were so many people there like us, excited to be taking pictures of the blooms and using them as a stunning background.\nFrom the nemophilia fields, Van and moved on to the rest of the park (skipping the amusement park since it was an additional cost and we already had two major theme parks on the trip itinerary).\nMy next favorite garden (and this park had so many) was the park‚Äôs Tamago no Mori tulip garden, which was huge ‚Äî at least in comparison to the last tulip garden I‚Äôd seen, Windmill Island Gardens in Holland, Michigan, during Tulip Time. Although both are obviously inspired by the tulip gardens of the Netherlands.\nTulips and grape hyacinths at Hitachi Seaside Park\rI loved the play of color, with some sections filled with only tulips of the same variety and color and others filled with a dazzling mix. Some were broken up with rivers of grape hyacinths. And behind the tulip garden were some people-sized egg sculptures with openings in them if you wanted to climb inside.\nVan climbed inside an egg sculpture\rOnce finished with the park, Van and I hopped on the bus back to Katsuta Station, where we popped into a convenience store to load up on food to eat on the train back to Tokyo for lunch.\nDining on conbini food on the shinkansen back to Tokyo\rKodokan #\rBack in Tokyo, we got off at Suidobashi Station and walked to the Kodokan, known as the birthplace of judo. Going to a shiai (judo contest) at the Kodokan had been one of Van‚Äôs requests, and one such match was taking place this evening.\nKano Jigoro Shihan, founder of Kodokan judo\rThe contest didn‚Äôt start until 5:30 p.m. but Van had expressly wanted to get to the Kodokan by 4 p.m. to give her time to peruse its gift shop kiosk and visit its museum. She also took a photo with the sculpture of Kano Jigoro Shihan, the founder of Kodokan judo, which stood at the front of the building.\nIt was still early and I noticed there was a hardware store next door. I‚Äôd lost my beloved Zojirishi water bottle sometime the day before ‚Äî it had fallen out of the side pocket of my day backpack ‚Äî and was in search of another water bottle. I found a nice replacement at this hardware store (though it‚Äôs not a Zojirushi) that I took back with me to the U.S., which is very typical of the type of functional souvenir that I tend to get when I travel.\nBack at the Kodokan, Van and I took the elevator up to the spectator seating area on the 8th floor. From the bleachers there, we were able to watch the participants of the shiai, men with 2nd dan and above, warming up for their matches.\nThe matches took place on two side-by-side courts. During the course of the shiai, a variety of other international visitors who filtered in and out of the spectator area. We watched until Van had her fill, and then returned to the hotel and made ready to check out the next morning, when we‚Äôd move on to Osaka.\n","date":"13 April 2023","permalink":"/posts/2023-04-13-day-04/","section":"Posts","summary":"Hitachi Seaside Park #\rAlthough we‚Äôd largely missed cherry blossom season in Tokyo, there were still plenty of other flowers in season.","title":"Day 4: Hitachi Seaside Park, the Kodokan"},{"content":"Our destination for the day was Nikko, a Unesco World Heritage Site and national park nearly two hours away by train from Tokyo. We got an early start by hopping on the shinkansen at Tokyo Station at 7:40 a.m. and transferring at Utsunomiya Station to a local line that took us to Nikko Station.\nWe arrived at about 9:30 a.m. It took me a bit to orient myself. Nikko Station, on the Japan Rail line, was down the street from Tobu-Nikko Station, which was on a private train line. We walked down to it because the bus platform was across the street. I‚Äôd planned on taking the bus to the Shinkyo Bridge, at the foot of Nikko Toshogu Shrine, but when I saw the crowd of tourists waiting to take the same bus, I knew I wanted to avoid getting packed into that sardine can. So we opted to walk the mile to the bridge instead.\nThe walk included passing by a shiba inu sprawled out on the sidewalk sleeping beside a sign that said, ‚ÄúPlease do not touch Japanese dog.‚Äù A older man whom I think was the owner was standing beside it and he got a little nervous as Van got real close to take a picture of the dog without actually touching it.\nNikko Pudding: Sadly it was closed when we walked by üò©\rMidway to the bridge, we came upon a grand Western-style building built in 1919 that was flanked by cherry trees in full blossom. A sign out front explained it was former Nikko City Hall. It still served as a municipal administration center and the surrounding area had been converted into a park.\nThe Shinkyo Bridge was quite picturesque but there was a charge to just walk on it, so we contented ourselves with just admiring it from the sidewalk.\nShinkyo Bridge\rWe crossed the street over to the Nikko World Heritage site. Instead of going to the paid and most famous portions of Nikko Toshogu Shrine ‚Äî and they do look sublime ‚Äî we took the 5-kilometer Takino trail, which skirted around the most popular parts of the site.\nPink rhodedendrons in bloom at Nikko\rThe stone-paved path led us through ancient cedar trees to a series of smaller, must less-visited shrines and sacred spots. I really enjoyed the quiet, solitude and shade of the forest and the lack of people, especially after enduring the crush of Tokyo.\nOne of the many buildings at Nikko Toshogu Shrine\rFor lunch, we circled back to a beautiful Western-style stone cottage housing the restaurant Meiji-no-Yakata. The cottage was built by F.W. Horn, founder of the Nippon Photograph Corporation during the Meiji area (1868-1912). It really evoked something you‚Äôd see out out of Anne of Green Gables on Prince Edward Island, or the Jordon Pond House in Acadia National Park in Maine.\nMeiji-no-Yakata\rWe got a lovely four-course meal that included a pumpkin soup, bread roll and salad, our main entry ‚Äî a deep-fried beef hamburg steak for Van, and crab croquettes for myself ‚Äî followed by a slice of cheesecake.\nOur cheesecake dessert at Meiji-no-Yakata\r","date":"12 April 2023","permalink":"/posts/2023-04-12-day-03/","section":"Posts","summary":"Our destination for the day was Nikko, a Unesco World Heritage Site and national park nearly two hours away by train from Tokyo.","title":"Day 3: Nikko"},{"content":"Enoshima #\rThe next morning Van and I hopped on a JR train to Fujisawa Station, where we transferred to the Enoshima Electric Railway. From there, we paid our fares with our SUICA cards to get to Enoshima Station.\nFrom the station, it was a quick walk to the bridge that took you to Enoshima, a tiny island off the coast to the south of Tokyo. I‚Äôd known, coming to Tokyo, that I would find Tokyo itself quite suffocating ‚Äî there‚Äôs just so many people ‚Äî and that the majority of the sightseeing I‚Äôd want to do would be further out, one to two hours away, as Enoshima was.\nThis picture is for Sally üòè\rIt was a clear day but so windy as we crossed the bridge. Luckily once we got onto the island, we were more protected from the elements. We were met immediately by charming shops, restaurants and cafes that lined Benzaiten Nakamise Dori, the main avenue, but it was mid-morning and most of them weren‚Äôt open yet.\nThe start of Benaiten Nakamise Dori is marked by a torii arch\rVan and I did slip into one of the lone stores that was open, a gift shop where she bought a cute coin purse to hold her Japanese cash.\nThe avenue sloped upward, leading to Enoshima Jinja Shrine, which actually is a series of shrines scattered around the island dedicated to Benten, a goddess of good fortune, wealth, music and knowledge.\nWe started to ascend the steps that took you further up the island ‚Äî there would be lots and lots of stairs to traverse ‚Äî but were met by a shrine cat, which immediately made my day better. It even let me pet it. Enoshima tourism literature calls itself ‚ÄúCat Island‚Äù but honestly this is the only cat we saw the entire day. Nevertheless, still a win!\nThe shrine cat greeted us when we arrived.\rOne of the many shrines that make up Enoshima Jinja Shrine\rWe passed a small public garden, where older man sat on a rock beside a water feature with an owl on perched on his arm. ü¶â I approached him and asked in my broken Japanese if I if was okay to take a picture. The man said yes while specifying that he didn‚Äôt want to be in the picture. Van and I admired the owl ‚Äî who was named Kome-chan, we learned ‚Äî while chatting with the man, who was very friendly and curious, asking where I was from and how I came to know Japanese.\nKome-chan the owl\rHappening upon a random owl was one of Vannie‚Äôs favorite moments of the day.\nAt the top of the island, we entered the Samuel Cocking Garden, which started out as the private garden of British merchant Samuel Cocking in 1882. Entry normally costs ¬•700 for adults but for whatever reason they were letting visitors in for free that day, perhaps because there was work being done inside the garden.\nThe Enoshima Sea Candle, an observation tower, is also located in the garden but we opted not to pay the fee to climb it; the views from the top of the island were enough for us.\nVan and I made our way to the Iwaya Caves, an ancient religious training location. The caves were created by erosion by the waves. They were opened to the public in 1993. The highlight of the self-guided tour of the two caves was when they gave us candle lanterns to take with us. The caves have enough electric lighting so that the lanterns weren‚Äôt necessary but they added to the atmosphere.\nNot far from the caves was a spot popular with kites, a kind of hawk. The wind was so strong they almost looked like they were essentially hovering in mid-air. We\u0026rsquo;d seen signs along the walkway warning visitors to keep a close eye on their food, as apparently the kites are known for dive bombing easy targets.\nBy the time Van and I made our way back to Benzaiten Nakamise Dori, the crowds were in full force and all the shops open, so I‚Äôm glad we‚Äôd come early in the day.\nA postcard of the shrine cat\rWe ate at Pico, an Italian restaurant on the street leading back to Enoshima Station. I got a nice creamy gnocchi and Van, a carbonara pasta.\nShin-Yokohama Ramen Museum #\rWe took the Enoshima Electric Railway back to Fujisawa Station, where we took a brief detour to breeze through a fabric and stationery shop as well as the local public library in the adjoining building.\nAt Fujisawa South Public Library, I was amazed to see nearly every seat was taken up by someone in the actual act of reading books. I say this because American libraries have evolved into such multipurpose buildings that when you visit them, there are just as many people using the computers or working on their laptops or participating in a program as there are people there for the actual reading material.\nWe continued on by train to Shin-Yokohama Station, where we disembarked and walked the short distance to the Shin-Yokohama Ramen Museum.\nAdult admission was ¬•380 (about $3), which honestly felt so cheap compared to American museum prices. This isn‚Äôt a knock at American museum prices ‚Äî I understand they need to price accordingly to be able to keep their doors open and provide quality exhibits ‚Äî but given that the quality of the ramen museum‚Äôs exhibits felt just as good for a museum of its smaller size, I honestly don‚Äôt understand how the ramen museum can price their admission so low.\nWe spent some time perusing the exhibits depicting the history of ramen in Japan but it‚Äôs the basement floor that we found most delightful. The entire floor is a replica of 1950s Tokyo, with nine ramen restaurants, each featuring ramen from different regions of Japan. You order via ticket vending machines at the front of each store.\nA replica of 1950s Tokyo at the Shin-Yokohama Ramen Museum\rIt was still mid-afternoon so we didn‚Äôt have any appetite to eat anything yet but we enjoyed meandering around the dark corridors and store fronts. They were so detailed and evocative and really transported you to another place and time in the same way that Diagon Alley and Knockturn Alley do at Universal Studios Orlando.\nWe still had some time left before turning in for the evening, so we took the train to Shibuya Station to check out Map Camera, a big camera shop known for good prices of new and used products. They didn‚Äôt have the lens I was looking for secondhand, either, but Van spotted another shop not far away, Kitamura Camera, which did.\nI‚Äôve long had a digital camera but it was the first time I‚Äôve bought an additional lens for it.

The QR code made satisfyingly quick work, though, once I found myself in front of the immigration agent.\nWith my passport now sporting a new Temporary Visitor to Japan sticker ‚Äî something we needed to get our JR Passes ‚Äî we continued on to Customs, where we again flashed our QR code to gain entrance, this time at an automated kiosk.\nWe made it!\rOnce we entered the airport proper, we had time to kill because it was still early and the Japan Rail ticket office where we‚Äôd pick up our JR Passes didn‚Äôt open until 6:45 a.m. We did a bit of exploring: The terminal we were in had a really neat shopping and dining area designed to mimic old-town Japan. I helped myself to my first vending machine purchase of the trip, a bottle of warm milk tea, which I paid for with my phone ‚Äî another new and very satisfying development from my last visit.\nI buy some hot milk tea at a drink vending machine using my phone.\rEventually we circled back to the ticket office, by which time a considerable line had formed. Vannie wandered around and withdrew some Japanese cash at a nearby ATM (I still had cash leftover from my 2013 trip üòÖ) while I waited in line for about 45 minutes with our passports in hand. Finally, though, I was able to get my hands on our golden tickets ‚Äî our not-cheap, but still amazing deals, 14-day JR Passes. (See my calculations on the JR Pass: Worth It? page.)\nOne big change with the pass since I‚Äôd last used it 10 years ago was that now it was the same size as a normal train ticket. This was a fantastic development, because it meant you could stick it into the automated ticket gate to gain entry. Before, the pass had been about passport-sized and you had to flash it to an employee to be able to go through.\nThis was also a concern because the new JR Passes were not reinforced or made of any special material; they were made from the same paper as single fare tickets.\nBetween its size, construction and material, I was terrified of forgetting to retrieve this pricey piece of paper when the ticket gate spit it back out, or losing or destroying it. The Japan Rail website is also very clear that you‚Äôre out of luck if this happens: ‚ÄúPlease note that the PASS cannot be reissued in the event that it is lost or stolen (Conditions for Use, #14).‚Äù\nWe‚Äôd been at the airport long enough, though. I shoved the pass into my pocket and together we headed to public transit to get out of there.\nAround Tokyo Station #\rThe Tokyo Monorail is included in your JR Pass access and conveniently, the monorail entrance at Haneda Airport was right by the ticket office.\nWe sailed right through the turnstiles ‚Äî so satisfying to stick in our passes and see them spit back out for retrieval ‚Äî and made our way up to the monorail platform.\nRiding the Tokyo Monorail\rBy then, it was full daylight so we had a great view of the city as we made our way to Hamamatsucho Station, where we transferred to a JR train that took us to Tokyo Station.\nWe arrived at Tokyo Station during morning rush hour.\rAt Tokyo Station, the central transit hub that we would use for all our travels in the area, we had a look around. We scouted out lockers because I knew we‚Äôd be needing them several times during the course of our trip. We bought some IC cards ‚Äî in our case, SUICA cards ‚Äî for the non-Japan Rail transportation we‚Äôd inevitably need from time to time. And we had our first meal, udon for me and soba for Van, at a noodle shop at the station where you inserted cash into a vending machine with tickets indicating your order.\nVan\u0026rsquo;s first meal in Japan\rSufficiently fed and roughly oriented, we made our way on foot to our accommodations, the Yaesu Terminal Hotel, which was a quick 5-minute walk from the station. It was still too early to check in, so we left our luggage with them and I picked up the WiFi hotspot I‚Äôd reserved with eConnect Japan and had mailed to the hotel in anticipation of our arrival. It‚Äôs a delight when things work as planned. I put the hotspot to work immediately.\nHitting the town #\rReturning to the Tokyo Station, we followed Google Maps‚Äô instructions to the bus platform that would take us to Toyosu Fish Market. We used our new SUICA cards to contactlessly pay for the ride: a tap when you boarded, and a tap when you alighted.\nWe arrived around 10 a.m., hours after the tuna auction action had ceased at 7 a.m. I‚Äôd known this going in but was still curious what we might be able to see. The famous tuna auction used to take place at Tsukiji Fish Market but it moved to Toyosu in 2018.\nToyosu Market\rEven though the auction was long over for the day, there were a fair number of others like us who still walked around the huge facility, peeking from the viewing area into the market area. There was a section of shops and restaurants inside the building as well. Van bought some taiyaki, a sweet fish-shaped cake with bean paste inside, that had been on her list of things she wanted to get while in Japan.\nFrom the fish market we walked to the nearby Toyosu Fish \u0026amp; Vegetable Market, which was much less popular with tourists but in a similarly huge building of its own with viewing areas to peek down at the crates of produce below and the machinery used to move them.\nVan and I then took the Yurikakome automated transit system (paying by SUICA) part of the way to our next destination: the Ginza area, where we hit a series of stores. I knew we‚Äôd be tired from our flight so had just wanted an simple day of sightseeing not too far from the hotel so that we that could retire in the late afternoon when I knew we‚Äôd be on our last legs.\nAnd that‚Äôs exactly what we did:\nItoya: 12 stories of stationery, pens and office supplies. Each floor a different theme. Heaven! ü§© I‚Äôd gone hoping to buy a very specific fountain pen but its price had risen considerably, so I satisfied myself with some lovely Japanese stationery as well as a plastic card holder for our precious JR Passes. Those holders served us well for the duration of the trip, keeping our passes in tip-top shape. Lemon Inc. Ginza: A shop of new and used cameras, lenses and camera equipment. I went in search of a specific zoom lens for my camera but the store didn‚Äôt have it secondhand. Sanrioworld Ginza: We ate lunch at Cafe Bridge, a kissaten in the Nishi Ginza shopping center that also housed the next stop on my list, Sanrioworld. Sanrioworld was honestly smaller than I was expecting for ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs largest Sanrio shop‚Äù but it still had plenty of merchandise, and I ended up buying some beautiful cherry blossom-covered note cards absolutely absent of Sanrio characters. Pokemon Center Tokyo DX: We went here for Van to peruse their merchandise. It was really busy ‚Äî getting a reservation at the Pokemon cafe is a whole process ‚Äî but similarly, not as big as I would have thought. (A consequence of growing up in the U.S., I‚Äôm sure!) Vannie catches them all\rFinally having gotten through our list of sightseeing destinations for the day, Van and I returned returned to our tiny hotel room, having stocked up on food at a convenience store at Tokyo Station, to eat and crash for the night.\n","date":"10 April 2023","permalink":"/posts/2023-04-10-day-01/","section":"Posts","summary":"Van and I left Portland, Oregon, the afternoon of Saturday, April 8, 2023.","title":"Day 1: Tokyo"},{"content":"How I got interested in Japan #\rCollege #\rMy interest in Japan first started in college in the late 1990s, when I joined my university‚Äôs anime club. They held showings weekly showings in a big lecture hall on campus from 7 p.m. to midnight. The turnout was always big and enthusiastic ‚Äî I really enjoyed hearing people‚Äôs boisterous reactions at dramatic moments ‚Äî and I often went with my friends (who probably went along to indulge me more than to enjoy the showing), so I think that really colored the positive associations I have with anime.\nDuring this time I was introduced to a number of anime series that I love to this day, including Rurouni Kenshin and Neon Genesis Evangelion.\nA corner in my dorm room with images from RK and NGE\rI usually bowed out of the showing by around 10 or 11 p.m. (I‚Äôve never been much night owl) but I went religiously every Friday for my first two years of college.\nI remember one weekend when I went to the anime club‚Äôs Friday night showing and then to another anime showing at the student union that weekend. Even though I‚Äôd never studied Japanese, the constant hours of unmitigated Japanese that I was hearing led to my having dreams in what clearly sounded like Japanese.\nJET #\rAfter I graduated, I continue to seek out anime and watch what I could, though it was much harder to access back then. While working at my first job out of college, a friend got into the Japan Exchange and Teaching (JET) program, which plops participants into schools across Japan to serve as assistant language teachers. Hearing about my friend‚Äôs experiences inspired me to apply, too.\nI got in, and soon found myself on a direct flight from Houston to Tokyo with my cohort in the summer of 2003. It was there that I first met Sally: She and I had been assigned to work in the same prefecture, Tokushima-ken, and were assigned to share a room at the Tokyo Hilton during orientation.\nSally and me at JET Orientation in Tokushima in 2003\rIt was a fortuitous pairing because we ended up becoming close friends as we navigated the intricacies of living in Japan as foreigners for the next two years. My time on the JET program remains a defining experience for me. We both had arrived not knowing any Japanese (something I don‚Äôt necessarily recommend ) and found ourselves learning both the language and the culture at the same time. By the end, my language skills remained laughable, but at least I knew enough to fumblingly travel around on my own.\nI teach an English lesson to a class of grade schoolers\rIn 2005, Sally and I both returned to our home countries ‚Äî Sally to England, and myself to the U.S. Though in the interim we were able to visit each other, it wasn‚Äôt until 2013 that we reunited in Japan.\nReturn to Japan #\rFinally I was able to take advantage of the fabled JR Pass, which allows unlimited travel on most Japan Rail trains but is only sold outside of Japan. We used it to cover a lot of ground, including Tokyo, Tokushima, Matsuyama, Nagasaki and Kagoshima.\nSally and I made it for cherry blossom season in 2013\rGiven how pleasurable it‚Äôd been to be back in Japan as a tourist (living as a temporary resident is an entirely different matter) in 2013, I was looking forward to the next trip back. This was back in 2019 as I started to make plans to visit again in spring 2020, this time with my sister Van. I was hoping to make it for cherry blossom season again so Van could experience that particular delight; she‚Äôd visited me in the summer of 2004 when I‚Äôd been living in Japan.\nAlas, COVID had other plans. In the end, I had to cancel all our reservations in late February 2020, weeks before Van and I were due to leave that March: for the JR Pass, the hotels and flights. I‚Äôm so grateful the vendors all agreed to refunds or credits.\nIt was such a chaotic, scary time on so many levels. Between 2020 and 2022, I quit my job, went back to school, moved across the country and got a new job. So it wasn‚Äôt until the latter half of last year that things stabilized enough ‚Äî and, most critically, Japan reopened its doors to tourists in October 2022 ‚Äî to put the trip back on the docket.\n","date":null,"permalink":"/background/","section":"Background","summary":"How I got interested in Japan #\rCollege #\rMy interest in Japan first started in college in the late 1990s, when I joined my university‚Äôs anime club.","title":"Background"},{"content":"\rThis pass got a lot of use!\rTL;DR: Yes. Yes it is. At least for us. And at least until the price increase in October 2023. YMMV.\nI got Japan Rail Passes for both my 2013 and 2023 Japan trips and I\u0026rsquo;ll be honest: I just trusted that they\u0026rsquo;d be worth it. I didn\u0026rsquo;t do the math because I just couldn\u0026rsquo;t be bothered.\nBut since returning from the April 2023 trip, I\u0026rsquo;ve been curious: Had our Japan Rail Pass, indeed, been worth its ¬•47,250 cost? I wanted proof! And the only way I could do that was to add up to the best of my ability all the Japan Rail rides we took on the 2023 trip.\nBelow is that table of all our Japan Rail rides as best as I can recall. Any public transit that wasn\u0026rsquo;t on Japan Rail, such as when we took the Yurikakome, Enoshima Elecric Railway or Osaka Metro, we paid with our SUICA cards and is not included in this table. I include the regular rate \u0026ndash; \u0026ldquo;Reg (¬•)\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; but some Japan Rail rides cost a few yen less if you pay with an IC card, so I included the slightly discounted rate here as well.\nIn addition, if we took a non-local train \u0026ndash; i.e., a shinkansen or a limited express \u0026ndash; I note if we got reserved or unreserved seats since reserved seats cost more.\nTable: 2023 Japan Rail rides #\rDate JR Station From JR Station To Reg (¬•) IC (¬•) Non-Local 10 April Haneda Airport Hamamatsucho 500 492 10 April Hamamatsucho Tokyo 170 167 11 April Tokyo Fujisawa 990 990 11 April Fujisawa Shin-Yokohama 594 590 11 April Shin-Yokohama Shinagawa 870 870 unreserved 11 April Shinagawa Shinjuku 590 590 11 April Shinjuku Tokyo 210 208 12 April Tokyo Utsunomiya 2,840 2,840 reserved 12 April Utsunomiya Nikko 770 770 12 April Nikko Utsunomiya 770 770 12 April Utsunomiya Tokyo 1,980 1,980 unreserved 13 April Tokyo Katsuta 3,890 3,890 reserved 13 April Katsuta Tokyo 2,310 2,310 unreserved 13 April Tokyo Suidobashi 170 167 13 April Suidobashi Tokyo 170 167 14 April Tokyo Nippori 170 167 14 April Nippori Tokyo 170 167 14 April Tokyo Shin-Osaka 14,400 14,400 reserved 15 April Shin-Osaka Okayama 6,140 6,140 reserved 15 April Okayama Hokaiin 150 150 15 April Hokaiin Okayama 150 150 15 April Okayama Shin-Osaka 5,610 5,610 unreserved 16 April Shin-Osaka Okayama 6,140 6,140 reserved 16 April Okayama Bizen Ichinomiya 210 210 16 April Soja Kurashiki 240 240 16 April Kurashiki Okayama 330 330 16 April Okayama Shin-Osaka 5,610 5,610 unreserved 17 April Shin-Osaka Universal City 230 230 17 April Universal City Shin-Osaka 230 230 18 April Shin-Osaka Tokyo 14,200 14,200 reserved 18 April Tokyo Omiya 1,670 1,670 unreserved 18 April Omiya Kawagoe 330 330 18 April Kawagoe Omiya 330 330 18 April Omiya Tokyo 1,670 1,670 unreserved 18 April Tokyo Maihama 230 230 20 April Maihama Tokyo 230 230 20 April Tokyo Oyama (Tochigi) 3,930 3,930 reserved 20 April Oyama (Tochigi) Ashikaga Flower Park 682 680 20 April Ashikaga Flower Park Oyama (Tochigi) 682 680 20 April Oyama (Tochigi) Omiya 1,990 1,990 unreserved 20 April Omiya Ikebukuro 410 406 20 April Ikebukuro Tokyo 210 208 20 April Tokyo Hamamatsucho 170 167 20 April Hamamatsucho Haneda Airport 500 492 TOTAL ¬•83,838 ¬•83,788 Conclusion #\rTo recap: A 14-day Japan Rail Pass costs ¬•47,250. During the course of our 11 days in Japan, we rode Japan Rail trains enough to rack up about ¬•83,800 in fares had we paid for each ride individually. That\u0026rsquo;s crazy! That\u0026rsquo;s 77 percent more than what we paid! üòÆ\nI knew the Japan Rail Pass was a good buy if just for its convenience alone. Its access to unlimited travel gives you the flexibility of being able to hop on and hop off trains without having to worry about constantly purchasing single fares. But to discover that the pass also saved us heaps of money as well is so satisfying. What an incredible value.\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s the good amazing news.\nIf you think that\u0026rsquo;s an almost inconceivable cost saving measure, imagine what Japan Rail must think. Their JR Pass prices haven\u0026rsquo;t change in decades.\nSo here\u0026rsquo;s the bad news. In April, coincidentally while Van and I were in Japan, Japan Rail announced that beginning in October 2023 they were finally raising the price of their passes. By a lot. The 14-day pass, for example, will go from ¬•47,250 to ¬•80,000: a 69 percent increase. (Which, surprisingly, almost exactly brings it in line with our usage of the JR Pass on this trip.) All of the other duration passes face a similar percentage in price hike.\n","date":null,"permalink":"/jrpass/","section":"JR Pass: Worth it?","summary":"This pass got a lot of use!","title":"JR Pass: Worth it?"},{"content":"I spent a lot of time planning this trip.

We saved screenshots of the following to our phones for when we arrived in Japan:\nCustoms declaration QR code Immigration QR code COVID vaccination FastTrack Japan does not require a visa for U.S. citizens traveling to Japan for short-term visits shorter than three months.\nFlight #\rIn November 2022, knowing that Japan was definitely open to tourists now and that we‚Äôd be leaving in six months, I configured an alert in Google Flights to track prices to Tokyo.\nIn December, I booked our air travel with United. The international leg would be through ANA (All Nippon Airways). Interestingly, the entire flight cost more than what we‚Äôd originally paid for our Spring 2020 trip (which was refunded to us due to COVID) but less than what I‚Äôd paid for my Spring 2013. But they were all pretty close.\nI set up another alert in Google Flights tracking specifically the price of our itinerary in case it went down. (It did not, and at one point, was running at nearly twice what we‚Äôd paid.)\nHotels #\rAs much as I enjoyed my 2013 visit to Japan precisely because we covered so much ground, I knew I wanted to go in the other direction for this trip and decrease the number of places we stayed at in order to minimize the schlepping of luggage. (In 2013, we‚Äôd stayed at six different places during the course of our 12 nights there.)\nSo this time I settled on a rough itinerary of four nights in central Tokyo, four nights in Osaka and two nights back in the Tokyo area near DisneySea.\nI ended up booking one accommodation each from these sites:\nHotels.com ‚Äî We found a very reasonably priced hotel, the Yaesu Terminal Hotel, a few minutes‚Äô walk away from Tokyo Station. The room was tiny, with two twin beds about a foot apart, but its location couldn‚Äôt be beat. AirBnB ‚Äî The AirBnB I reserved was in a quiet neighborhood and a 10-minute walk from JR Shin-Osaka Station and and a 5-minute walk from the Higashimikuni Metro Station. Japanican ‚Äî I booked a room at Spa \u0026amp; Hotel Maihama Eurasia because it was less than a mile walk to DisneySea. In addition, it had a shuttle that ran between JR Maihama Station and the hotel three times an hour, saving us what would have felt like an endless walk (even though it was just a mile) due to having our luggage with us. After the cozy quarters we‚Äôd been staying in, this hotel room felt ridiculously spacious. Transportation #\rI ordered our 14-day Japan Rail Passes from Klook about a month and a half before our trip. You don\u0026rsquo;t want to order them early because they have to be redeemed within three months and you don\u0026rsquo;t want to order them too late to ensure they have time to get shipped to you before your trip.\nThe vouchers arrived soon after I placed my order and I safely tucked them away to bring with us to exchange for the actual passes once we arrived in Japan.\nBecause the JR Pass predominantly covers Japan Rail trains (as well as some extras like the Tokyo Monorail), I knew there‚Äôd be times we‚Äôd be taking non-JR transportation like the Tokyo Metro and the Osaka Metro, so I planned to also purchase a SUICA card once we arrived in Tokyo.\nWiFi #\rHonestly, having access to a WiFi hotspot is a game changer when it comes travel.\nWhen I‚Äôd last been in Japan 10 years ago, I‚Äôd not had Internet access except when at our accommodations. Knowing that, I‚Äôd saved a bunch of train time tables and notes to my phone so I‚Äôd have access to them offline. And even that was an upgrade from before, when I lived in Japan in the mid-2000s and not had a mobile phone at all!\nI relied on those notes to guide us when making shinkansen reservations but outside of reserved rides, we just went with the flow and knew the train would come when it came and to enjoy the experience. We never had to wait all that long.\nI reserved our WiFi hotspot from eConnect Japan. I probably got one data tier too high ‚Äî I‚Äôd wanted to make sure both Van and I would have plenty to work with, but in the end it was mostly just me using it ‚Äî and even at that rate, I found the price still quite reasonable and the service, totally reliable.\nThe hotspot was delivered to our hotel in Tokyo a day or two before our arrival. It came with a battery bank, which I did find I needed to use when our days ran long, charging cable and adapter, as well as a prepaid envelope to returning it. When we returned to Haneda Airport to fly back to the U.S., I popped the hotspot and all its accessories into the envelope and dropped it into a mailbox at Haneda‚Äôs Departures area. So convenient!\nApps #\rI downloaded these apps to my phone and found all of them useful:\nNavitime ‚Äî For checking train times. It has a handle filter that allows you mark that you have a JR Pass so it will just check routes and timetables between JR stations. Between the two route planners I installed, I did find this one more reliably listed the platforms from which the trains departed but overall both worked great for me. Japan Transit Planner ‚Äî Also for checking train times; it was just nice to be able to have two route planners in order to be able to view different options at the same time. Also has the JR Pass filter. Google Translate ‚Äî I used the Google Lens feature the most: when you use your phone camera to scan signs or text and Google Translate overlays the translation. So useful! But I also occasionally used the text input feature, too, to translate English to Japanese, such as when I wanted to have some words ready when we visited a customer service desk to explain that Van had lost the receipt that you used to unlock your locker. Universal Studios Japan ‚Äî For ride wait times and the map feature. Tokyo Disney Resort ‚Äî Covers both Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea. We used it for ride wait times and the map feature. Duolingo ‚Äî I used this language-learning app right up until the day before we left for Japan to review basic Japanese vocabulary and kanji, particularly for numbers. Tickets #\rIf I could order tickets ahead of time, I did, so as to knock out the chore while still comfortably at home in the planning phase rather than when we were actually in Japan.\nteamLab Osaka #\rFor visiting the teamLab art installation at Nagai Botanical Garden in Osaka at night. The email confirmation included a link that went live the day of my reservation with a QR code. (We still had to wait in line, as everyone still had to go through a bag check and were granted admittance to the park in batches.)\nUniversal Studios Japan #\rVan and I bought both our USJ tickets and Express Passes from Klook. The Express Passes cost more than the tickets! ü´†\nI really hate how complicated Universal Studios makes its Express Passes ‚Äî there are so many options. We‚Äôd wanted to get the Express Passes for the two Harry Potter rides but they were sold out by the time I tried to buy them a month before. We ended up getting the University Express 4 ~ Fun - Ride ~, which had other rides that we were interested in, so it worked out all right for us. We got vouchers with QR codes and they were scanned at entry.\nDisneySea #\rOur DisneySea tickets were also ordered from Klook, which again sent us vouchers with QR codes that were scanned at entry.\nDisneySea does have a program similar to USJ‚Äôs Express Pass called Premier Access but this wasn‚Äôt an option in Klook. You‚Äôre supposed to be able to order Premier Access via the Tokyo Disney Resort app, but the app really doesn‚Äôt accept credit cards outside Japan. I looked around online and did see instances in which people were able to get this route to work for them but it usually involved something ridiculously like trying 10 times and finally succeeding on Try #10.\nSo we just waited until we were at the theme park and got Premier Access by purchasing at Guest Relations in person.\n","date":null,"permalink":"/planning/","section":"Planning","summary":"I spent a lot of time planning this trip.","title":"Planning"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"}]
